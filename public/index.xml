      <description>Introduction The ‘health’ dataset is the 2019 Country Health Rankings and Roadmaps dataset and describes different health-realted statistics in Texas counties. Variables include Texas counties by name, average life expectancy, population size for the county, and average household income. The border status variable categrizes each county as a border or non-border county, defining a any county within 100 Kilometers of the U.S. and Mexico border as a border county. The urbanization status variable categorizes each county into rural or urban based on population density and other measures of dense development.</description>

      <description>0.Introduction The data from ‘healthmx’ was collected during Summer 2019 as part of UT Austin’s President’s Award for Global Learning. Three rural pueblos and one urban colonia popular surrounding Atlixco, Puebla, Mexico were selected to conduct a comprehensive community health needs assessment in order to understand and address health inequities that are present in these low-income communities.The dataset used for this assignment was created from the semi-quantitative household survey data, is heavily redacted, and much smaller than the actual dataset, which had over 200 questions.</description>

      <description>Introduction This tutorial will show you how to create a simple theme in Hugo. I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won&amp;rsquo;t cover using CSS to style your theme.
We&amp;rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template.</description>

      <description>Hugo uses the excellent go html/template library for its template engine. It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in go templates.
This document is a brief primer on using go templates.</description>

      <title>Migrate to Hugo from Jekyll</title>

      <description>Move static content to static Jekyll has a rule that any directory not starting with _ will be copied as-is to the _site output. Hugo keeps all static content under static. You should therefore move it all there. With Jekyll, something that looked like
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ images/ logo.png  should become
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ static/ ▾ images/ logo.png  Additionally, you&amp;rsquo;ll want any files that should reside at the root (such as CNAME) to be moved to static.</description>
